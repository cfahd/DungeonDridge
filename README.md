## Description

The application is intended to be used alongside the physical board game to aid in keeping track of crucial game metrics, functions such as rolling dice, and much more to enhance the game experience. The application is highly functional, making use of multiple classes. The application is visually appealing and has a very intricate GUI with which users can interact to facilitate their game experience. The application keeps track of multiple players, their damage, armor, and other vital statistics to facilitate the physical game created by my team and I being DungeonDrudge.
